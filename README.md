This is a ongoing project by Phillip Mai and Hugh Phung. The goal and main idea is to make a website that allows users to input characters and weapons in their lineup, and filter/organize them in order to help with forming a team used in endgame content. This is a work-in-progress build, and will likely need major changes in the future. Just 2 UCSD students having fun and learning as they work their way through a passion project.
