**VERY IMPORTANT**
Steps of git: 
- change directory to genshin project
- git checkout main (for latest version)
- git pull origin main (to load latest version)
- git checkout -b [insert-name] 
- make your edits
- SAVE YOUR EDITS
- git add --all (once finished)
- git commit -m "[insert message]"
- git push origin [branch name]

/ if you are somehow on some diverged branch and you want to get back to the remote main, just git reset --hard origin/main
and / or use this website: https://jvns.ca/blog/2024/02/01/dealing-with-diverged-git-branches/


Tests Cases
- check duplicates
- check filescan
- check for valid elements
- check for valid weapontypes
- removes the correct character
- search method (name)
- filter by element
- filter by weapontype
- correct ordered list by base attack (char/weap)
  o filter by certain amount of attack (char/weap)

class [name of file] {

    [type] [name of test] = this.[method name]() //expected value

    OR

    //Tests
    void [method name](Tester t) {
        t.checkExpect(this.vc1.isCommentByAuthor(this.u1), true);
        t.checkExpect(this.vc1.isCommentByAuthor(u2), false);
        [...tests]
